Engineering judgment should be used to determine what, if any, portion of the right-turning traffic is subtracted from the minor-street traffic count when evaluating the count against the signal warrants listed in Paragraph 2 of this Section. 09 Engineering judgment should also be used in applying various traffic signal warrants to cases where major-street approaches consist of one lane plus one left-turn or right-turn lane. The site-specific traffic characteristics should dictate whether a major-street approach is considered as one lane or two lanes. For example, for a major-street approach with one lane for through and right-turning traffic plus a left-turn lane, if engineering judgment indicates that it should be considered a one-lane approach because the traffic using the left-turn lane is minor, the total traffic volume approaching the intersection should be applied against the signal warrants as a one-lane approach. The major-street approach should be considered two lanes if approximately half of the traffic on the approach turns left and the left-turn lane is of sufficient length to accommodate all left-turning vehicles. 10 Similar engineering judgment and rationale should be applied to a minor-street approach with one through/ left-turn lane plus a right-turn lane. In this case, the degree of conflict of minor-street right-turning traffic with traffic on the major street should be considered. Thus, right-turning traffic should not be included in the minor- street volume if the movement enters the major street with minimal conflict. The minor-street approach should be evaluated as a one-lane approach with only the traffic volume in the through/left-turn lane considered. Final - Pending Approval  Part 4.

Except for locations where the engineering study uses the satisfaction of Warrant 8 to justify a signal, a traffic control signal installed under projected conditions should have an engineering study done within 1 year of putting the signal into steady (stop-and-go) operation to determine if the signal is justified. If not justified, the signal should be taken out of steady (stop-and-go) operation or removed."

Turning after stopping is permitted as stated in Item C.1 in Paragraph 1 of Section 4A.03. 2.\t Shall be displayed with the appropriate GREEN ARROW signal indications when it is intended to permit traffic to make a specified turn or turns, and to prohibit traffic from proceeding straight ahead through the intersection or other controlled area, except in protected only mode operation (see Sections 4F.06 and 4F.13), or in protected/permissive mode operation with separate turn signal faces (see Sections 4F.08 and 4F.15).

The lane-use control signal system shall be designed to reliably guard against showing any prohibited combination of signal indications to any traffic at any point in the controlled lanes. 02 For reversible lane control signals, the following combination of signal indications shall not be simultaneously displayed over the same lane to both directions of travel: A.\t DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW in both directions, B.\t YELLOW X in both directions, C.\t WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW in both directions, D.\t DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW in one direction and YELLOW X in the other direction, E.\t WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW or WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW in one direction and DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW in the other direction, F.\t WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW in one direction and WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT- TURN ARROW in the other direction, and G.\t WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW in one direction and YELLOW X in the other direction. 03 A moving condition in one direction shall be terminated either by the immediate display of a RED X signal indication or by a YELLOW X signal indication followed by a RED X signal indication. 04 In either case, the duration of the RED X signal indication shall be an appropriate duration to allow traffic time to vacate the lane before any moving condition is allowed in the opposing direction. 05 Whenever a DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW signal indication is changed to a WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW signal indication, the RED X signal indication shall continue to be displayed to the opposite direction of travel for an appropriate duration to allow traffic time to vacate the lane being converted to a two-way left-turn lane. 06 If an automatic control system is used, a manual control to override the automatic control shall be provided.",

B.\t They shall initiate operation based on pedestrian actuation and shall cease operation at a predetermined time after the pedestrian actuation or, with passive detection, after the pedestrian clears the crosswalk.

D.\t They shall be installed in the area between the outside edge of the crosswalk line and 10 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk. E.\t They shall face away from the crosswalk if unidirectional, or shall face away from and across the crosswalk if bidirectional. 03 If used on one-lane, one-way roadways, a minimum of two In-Roadway Warning Lights shall be installed on the approach side of the crosswalk. If used on two-lane roadways, a minimum of three In- Roadway Warning Lights shall be installed along both sides of the crosswalk.
