Instead, when determined necessary to advise of new regulations as part of an educational campaign, temporary signs or messages should be used instead of permanent signs. These temporary signs or messages should be used sparingly and only at strategic locations, and should be considered only as a supporting element of a larger educational campaign rather than as the primary source of notification. If engineering judgment determines a need for a permanent sign to distinguish between differing requirements of similar statutes in different jurisdictions, then a sign should be located in the vicinity of the jurisdictional boundary, and should be located away from warning, directional, and higher-priority regulatory signs, so as not to contribute to sign clutter (see Section 2A.20)."

For mixed-case legends (those composed \nof an initial upper-case letter followed by lower-case letters), the height of the lower-case letters is derived from \nthe specified height of the initial upper-case letter based on a prescribed ratio. Letter heights for mixed-case \nlegends might be expressed in terms of both the upper- and lower-case letters, or in terms of the initial upper-\ncase letter alone. When the height of a lower-case letter is specified or determined from the prescribed ratio, the \nreference is to the nominal loop height of the letter. The term loop height refers to the portion of a lower-case \nletter that excludes any ascending or descending stems or tails of the letter, such as with the letters “d” or “q.”  \nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 49\nPart 2.

The actual loop height of a rounded \nlower-case letter is slightly greater than the nominal loop height and this additional height is excluded from the \nexpression of the lower-case letter height."

Signs\nJanuary 2026\n02\t\t\nLED units that are used to illuminate the full sign display, background, or legend are changeable message \nsigns (CMS), which are covered in Chapters 2B, 2C, and 2L, and Part 7.\n03\t\t\nThe application of LED units in compliance with Paragraph 8 of this Section does not create a changeable \nmessage sign because the legend of the sign is always displayed when the LED units are not illuminated. \nChangeable message or blank-out signs whose legends change or extinguish by means of illuminated elements \nare addressed elsewhere in this Manual.\nOption:\n04\t\t\nLight-emitting diode (LED) units may be used individually within the symbol, legend, or border of a sign to \nenhance the sign conspicuity and legibility (see Section 2A.11).\n05\t\t\nExcept as provided in Paragraph 11 of this Section, LED units may either operate continuously or be actuated.\nStandard:\n06\t\t\nWhere LED units are used to enhance the conspicuity of a sign, the sign shall otherwise comply with the \nrequirements for retroreflection and illumination for nighttime viewing (see Section 2A.21). \n07\t\t\nExcept as provided in Paragraphs 16 and 17 of this Section, and for changeable message signs, neither \nindividual LEDs nor groups of LEDs shall be placed within the background area of a sign.\n08\t\t\nThe application of LEDs to display sign legends or symbols shall use a maximum pitch of 20 millimeters \nto cover the stroke width of the letter or symbol.\n09\t\t\nThe LEDs shall not protrude outside the sign border or legend when used in such applications, shall \nhave a maximum diameter of ¼ inch, and shall be the following colors based on the type of sign:\nA.\t White or red, with STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER, or WRONG WAY signs.\nB.\t White, with other regulatory signs.\nC.\t White or yellow, with warning signs.\nD.\t White or green, with guide signs.\nE.\t White, yellow, or orange, with temporary traffic control signs.\nF.\t White, yellow, or fluorescent yellow-green, with school area or pedestrian or bicycle warning signs.\n10\t\t\nIf flashed, all LED units shall flash simultaneously at a steady rate between 50 and 60 times per \nminute. All the LED units in a sign legend or border shall be illuminated simultaneously with no sequential \n(chasing) or variable flash rates (dancing), except as otherwise allowed in this Manual. A cluster of LEDs \nshall not be used within the border of a sign.\n11\t\t\nWhere used in STOP or YIELD signs, flashing LED units shall operate continuously. Actuation of the \nLED units shall not be allowed.\n12\t\t\nFlashing LED units shall not be used within the legend or border of a Speed Limit sign to indicate that \nthe displayed speed limit is in effect.\n13\t\t\nLED units shall not be used within the legend or border of a sign in conjunction with the phrase WHEN \nFLASHING in its legend or on a supplemental WHEN FLASHING plaque (see Item E in Paragraph 1 of \nSection 4S.03 for the use of Warning Beacons to indicate when a regulatory or warning message is in effect).\n14\t\t\nWhere LED units are used along the edge of a sign, at least one LED unit shall be placed along each \nedge of the sign, in addition to one LED unit at each corner of the sign, so that the distinct outline of the sign \nshape is recognized under nighttime viewing conditions. The LED units along each side of the sign shall be \nspaced approximately equidistantly. For a circular sign shape, the number of LED units shall clearly form \nthe appearance of a circle and not be perceived as some other shape. \n15\t\t\nThe uniformity of the sign design shall be maintained without any decrease in visibility, legibility, \nor driver comprehension during either daytime or nighttime conditions. The LED units shall have the \ncapability to be dimmed automatically by a timing mechanism or a device sensitive to ambient light \n(photoelectric cell) such that the LEDs do not reduce the visibility of the sign legend.\nOption:\n16\t\t\nFor STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER, and WRONG WAY signs, LEDs may be placed within the border or \nwithin one border width within the background of the sign. \nSupport:\n17\t\t\nThe VWAPM Section 6D.02 contains information about STOP/SLOW paddles used by flaggers. \nSection 7D.02 contains information about STOP paddles used by adult crossing guards. \n18\t\t\nOther methods of enhancing the conspicuity of standard signs are described in Section 2A.11.\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 53\nPart 2.

Signs in other locations should be considered only as supplementary to signs in the normal locations, except as otherwise provided in this Manual. 06 Signs should be individually installed on separate posts or mountings except where: A.\t One sign supplements another; B.\t Route or directional signs are grouped to clarify information to motorists; C.\t Regulatory signs that do not conflict with each other are grouped, such as Turn Prohibition signs posted with ONE WAY signs or a parking regulation sign posted with a Speed Limit sign; or D.\t Street Name signs are posted with a STOP or YIELD sign. 07 Signs should be located so that they: A.\t Are outside the clear zone unless placed on a crashworthy (see definition in Section 1C.02) support, B.\t Optimize nighttime visibility, C.\t Minimize the effects of mud splatter and debris, D.\t Do not obscure each other, E.\t Do not obscure the sight distance to approaching vehicles on the major street for drivers who are stopped on minor-street approaches, and F.\t Are not hidden from view. 08 Except for STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER, and WRONG WAY signs, or as otherwise provided in this Manual, where a sign on a one-way roadway indicates an action intended exclusively or primarily for a road user in the left-hand lane or at the left-hand side of that roadway, such as LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT (R3-7) or LEFT LANE ENDS (W9-1), the sign should be located on the left-hand side of the roadway.

              "13 Because regulatory and warning information is typically more critical to the road user than guidance information, regulatory and warning signing whose locations are critical should be displayed rather than guide signing in cases where conflicts occur. In such cases, the guide sign should be relocated to another appropriate location where it will still be effective. In other cases, such as at a decision point, the guide sign should take precedence over other signs whose locations are not as critical to an immediate decision or action necessary by the road user. In all cases, careful attention should be given to minimizing sign clutter (see Section 2A.20). Community wayfinding and acknowledgment guide signs should have a lower priority as to placement than other guide signs. Signs conveying information of a less-critical nature should be moved to less-critical locations or omitted.",

The width of the clear zone is dependent upon traffic volumes, speeds, and roadside geometry. Additional information can be found in the “Roadside Design Guide,” 4th Edition, 2011, AASHTO.",
              "12 An order of priority is especially critical where space is limited for sign installation and there is a demand for several different types of signs.

Examples of heights and lateral locations of \nsigns for typical installations are illustrated in Figure 2A-2(VA), and examples of locations for some typical signs \nat intersections are illustrated in Figure 2A-3 and all four sheets in Figure 2A-4.\n02\t\t\nExamples of advance signing on intersection approaches are illustrated in all four sheets in Figure 2A-4. \nChapters 2B, 2C, and 2D contain provisions regarding the application of regulatory, warning, and guide \nsigns, respectively.\nStandard:\n03\t\t\nSigns requiring separate decisions by the road user shall be spaced sufficiently far apart for the \nappropriate decisions to be made. \nGuidance:\n04\t\t\nOne of the factors considered when determining the appropriate spacing of signs should be the posted or \n85th-percentile speed. \n05\t\t\nExcept as provided in Paragraph 8 of this Section, signs should be located on the right-hand side of the \nroadway where they are easily recognized and understood by road users. Signs in other locations should be \nconsidered only as supplementary to signs in the normal locations, except as otherwise provided in this Manual.\n06\t\t\nSigns should be individually installed on separate posts or mountings except where:\nA.\t One sign supplements another;\nB.\t Route or directional signs are grouped to clarify information to motorists;\nC.\t Regulatory signs that do not conflict with each other are grouped, such as Turn Prohibition signs posted \nwith ONE WAY signs or a parking regulation sign posted with a Speed Limit sign; or\nD.\t Street Name signs are posted with a STOP or YIELD sign.\n07\t\t\nSigns should be located so that they:\nA.\t Are outside the clear zone unless placed on a crashworthy (see definition in Section 1C.02) support,\nB.\t Optimize nighttime visibility,\nC.\t Minimize the effects of mud splatter and debris,\nD.\t Do not obscure each other,\nE.\t Do not obscure the sight distance to approaching vehicles on the major street for drivers who are \nstopped on minor-street approaches, and\nF.\t Are not hidden from view.\n08\t\t\nExcept for STOP, YIELD, DO NOT ENTER, and WRONG WAY signs, or as otherwise provided in this \nManual, where a sign on a one-way roadway indicates an action intended exclusively or primarily for a road user \nin the left-hand lane or at the left-hand side of that roadway, such as LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT (R3-7) \nor LEFT LANE ENDS (W9-1), the sign should be located on the left-hand side of the roadway. In the case of a \ndivided road, the sign should be located in the median.\nOption:\n09\t\t\nSigns located on the left-hand side of a one-way roadway or in the median of a divided road, in accordance \nwith Paragraph 8 of this Section, may be supplemented by an identical sign located on the right-hand side of \nthe roadway.\nSupport:\n10\t\t\nThe clear zone (see definition in Section 1C.02) is the total roadside border area, starting at the edge of the \ntraveled way, available for an errant driver to stop or regain control of a vehicle. The width of the clear zone is \ndependent upon traffic volumes, speeds, and roadside geometry. Additional information can be found in the \n“Roadside Design Guide,” 4th Edition, 2011, AASHTO.\nGuidance:\n11\t\t\nWith the increase in traffic volumes and the need to provide road users regulatory, warning, and guidance \ninformation, an order of priority for sign installation should be established.\nSupport:\n12\t\t\nAn order of priority is especially critical where space is limited for sign installation and there is a demand \nfor several different types of signs. Overloading road users with too much information is not desirable. Priority \naccording to type of sign will depend on the specific situation and conditions of the site at which the signs are to \nbe installed. For example, in the vicinity of an exit ramp, guide signs and warning signs for the exit ramp might \ntake precedence over regulatory signs that confirm rules of the road, such as a STATE LAW-NO HANDHELD \nPHONE USE BY DRIVER sign, or a mainline Speed Limit sign where there is no change in the speed zone. \nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nPage 60\t\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\nPart 2. Signs\nJanuary 2026\nGuidance:\n13\t\t\nBecause regulatory and warning information is typically more critical to the road user than guidance \ninformation, regulatory and warning signing whose locations are critical should be displayed rather than guide \nsigning in cases where conflicts occur. In such cases, the guide sign should be relocated to another appropriate \nlocation where it will still be effective. In other cases, such as at a decision point, the guide sign should take \nprecedence over other signs whose locations are not as critical to an immediate decision or action necessary \nby the road user. In all cases, careful attention should be given to minimizing sign clutter (see Section 2A.20). \nCommunity wayfinding and acknowledgment guide signs should have a lower priority as to placement than other \nguide signs. Signs conveying information of a less-critical nature should be moved to less-critical locations or \nomitted.\nOption:\n14\t\t\nUnder some circumstances, such as on curves to the right, signs may be placed on median islands or on the \nleft-hand side of the road. A supplementary sign located on the left-hand side of the roadway may be used on a \nmulti-lane road where traffic in a lane to the right might obstruct the view to the right.\nGuidance:\n15\t\t\nIn urban areas where crosswalks exist, signs should not be placed within 4 feet in advance of the crosswalk \n(see Drawing D in Figure 2A-3)."

              "01 The Integrated Directional Signing Program (IDSP) provides Virginia motorist service businesses, attractions, tourist destinations, and other specific points of interest with a single contact for the purpose of having their logo/business identified on a road sign along VDOT-maintained roadways to provide motorists with directional guidance and information about their location. IDSP signs are installed, maintained, modified, and removed by the IDSP contractor. Additional information, such as the current contractor for the IDSP, can be found on VDOT’s IDSP website. 02 There are four main types of traffic control device signs that are included within the IDSP: A.\t Specific Service Signing – Specific Service Signs (Logo) provide the motorist directional guidance to the providers of Gas, Food, Lodging, Camping, and Attractions destinations near interchanges of limited access roadways. Additional information on Specific Service Signs can be found in Chapter 2J. B.\t Tourist-Oriented Directional Signing – Tourist-Oriented Directional Signs (TODS) guide motorists to tourist-oriented businesses, services, and activity facilities along rural primary and secondary highways that do not have limited access. Additional information on TODS can be found in Chapter 2K. C.\t Supplemental Guide Signing – Supplemental Guide Signs guide motorists to specific cultural, recreational, historical, governmental, educational, military, and other sites of similar interest from limited access, primary, and secondary roadways. This program excludes Supplemental Guide Signs for cities, towns, villages, counties, regions, communities, named roads/streets, transportation facilities, and other governmental entities, which are installed and maintained by VDOT (i.e. Charlottesville EXIT 221).

Setting appropriate speed limits is especially important to ensure safety for all road users in varying types of contexts, particularly on roadways where adjacent land use suggests that trips could be served by varied modes. These situations include urban and suburban non-freeway arterials or rural arterials that serve as main streets in smaller communities, consistent with the context classifications of urban core, urban, suburban, and rural towns found in “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,” 2018 Edition, AASHTO.

As speed limit setting tools vary, jurisdictions need to be aware of their limitations and advantages, possible variation between the tools and the need to explore gaps or weaknesses of tools, and weigh the output accordingly in consideration of setting speed limits. 05 To achieve desired operating speeds, agencies often implement other speed management strategies concurrently with setting speed limits, such as traffic calming measures, geometric design features, speed safety cameras, and increased enforcement.",

Signs\nJanuary 2026\nGuidance:\n09\t\t\nWhen a gate that is rotated in a horizontal plane is in the position where it is parallel to traffic (indicating \nthat the roadway is open), the outer end of the gate arm should be rotated to the downstream direction (from the \nperspective of traffic in the lane adjacent to the gate support) to prevent spearing if the gate is struck by an errant \nvehicle.\nStandard:\n10\t\t\nIf red lights are attached to a traffic gate, the red lights shall be steadily illuminated or flashed only \nduring the period when the gate is in the horizontal or closed position and when the gate is in the process \nof being opened or closed.\n11\t\t\nExcept as provided in Paragraph 6 of this Section, rolling sections of fence, if used, shall include either \na horizontal strip of retroreflective sheeting on both sides of the fence with vertical stripes alternately \nred and white at 16-inch intervals measured horizontally to simulate the appearance of a gate arm in the \nhorizontal position, or one or more Type 4 object markers (see Section 2C.73), or both. If a horizontal \nstrip of retroreflective sheeting is used, the bottom of the sheeting shall be located 3.5 to 4.5 feet above the \nroadway surface.\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 165\nPart 2.

The distances for Condition B (with the exception of the potential stop condition) have been adjusted for a sign legibility distance of 250 feet, which is appropriate for an alignment warning symbol sign. For Conditions A and B, warning signs with less than 6-inch legend or more than four words, a minimum of 100 feet should be added to the advance placement distance to provide adequate legibility of the warning sign. 2 \u0007Typical conditions are locations where the road user must use extra time to adjust speed and change lanes in heavy traffic because of a complex driving situation. Typical signs are Merge and Right Lane Ends. The distances are determined by providing the driver a PRT of 14.0 to 14.5 seconds for vehicle maneuvers (2018 AASHTO Policy, Table 3-3, Decision Sight Distance, Avoidance Maneuver E) and adjusted for a legibility distance of 180 feet for the appropriate sign. 3 \u0007Typical condition is the warning of a potential stop situation. Typical signs are Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead, Signal Ahead, and Intersection Warning signs. The distances are based on the 2018 AASHTO Policy, Table 3-1, Stopping Sight Distance, providing a PRT of 2.5 seconds, a deceleration rate of 11.2 feet/second2. 4 \u0007Typical conditions are locations where the road user must decrease speed to maneuver through the warned condition. Typical signs are Turn, Curve, Reverse Turn, or Reverse Curve. The distance is determined by providing a 2.5 second PRT, a vehicle deceleration rate of 10 feet/second2, and adjusted for a sign legibility distance of 250 feet. 5 \u0007No suggested distances are provided for these speeds, as the placement location is dependent on site conditions and other signing. An alignment warning sign may be placed anywhere from the point of curvature up to 100 feet in advance of the curve. However, the alignment warning sign should be installed in advance of the curve and at least 100 feet from any other signs. 6 \u0007The minimum advance placement distance is listed as 100 feet to provide adequate spacing between signs.

              "01 Standardization of position cannot always be attained in practice. Examples of heights and lateral locations of signs for typical installations are illustrated in Figure 2A-2(VA), and examples of locations for some typical signs at intersections are illustrated in Figure 2A-3 and all four sheets in Figure 2A-4. 02 Examples of advance signing on intersection approaches are illustrated in all four sheets in Figure 2A-4. Chapters 2B, 2C, and 2D contain provisions regarding the application of regulatory, warning, and guide signs, respectively.",
              "10 The clear zone (see definition in Section 1C.02) is the total roadside border area, starting at the edge of the traveled way, available for an errant driver to stop or regain control of a vehicle. The width of the clear zone is dependent upon traffic volumes, speeds, and roadside geometry. Additional information can be found in the “Roadside Design Guide,” 4th Edition, 2011, AASHTO.",
              "12 An order of priority is especially critical where space is limited for sign installation and there is a demand for several different types of signs. Overloading road users with too much information is not desirable. Priority according to type of sign will depend on the specific situation and conditions of the site at which the signs are to be installed. For example, in the vicinity of an exit ramp, guide signs and warning signs for the exit ramp might take precedence over regulatory signs that confirm rules of the road, such as a STATE LAW-NO HANDHELD PHONE USE BY DRIVER sign, or a mainline Speed Limit sign where there is no change in the speed zone.

              "02 The operational requirements of the present highway system are such that overhead signs have value at many locations. The factors to be considered for the installation of overhead sign displays are not definable in specific numerical terms. In some cases, overhead mounting of a sign might be required by other provisions of this Manual.",
              "05 Under some circumstances, the use of over-crossing structures as sign supports might be the only practical solution that will provide adequate viewing distance. The use of such structures as sign supports might eliminate the need for the foundations and sign supports along the roadside. Section 2A.15  Mounting Height",
              "02 It might be necessary to use larger minimum mounting heights than those prescribed in this Manual to ensure appropriate crash performance of sign installations that are required to be crashworthy (see Section 1D.11). 03 In addition to the provisions of this Section, information affecting the minimum mounting height of signs as a function of crash performance can be found in the “Roadside Design Guide,” 4th Edition, 2011, AASHTO.",
              "09 Section 9A.02 contains provisions for the minimum mounting height of signs on shared-use paths.",

              "05 The minimum lateral offset requirements for object markers are provided in Chapter 2C. 06 The minimum lateral offset is intended to keep trucks and cars that use the shoulders from striking the signs or supports. The minimum lateral offset requirements do not supersede the requirement for crashworthiness (see Paragraph 2 of this Section) if the sign is located within the clear zone.",
              "12 Guidance for maintaining sign shape in laterally-constrained conditions is described in Section 2A.05. 13 Figures 2A-2(VA) and 2A-3 illustrate some examples of the lateral offset requirements contained in this Section. Section 2A.17  Orientation",
              "02 The latest edition of AASHTO’s “Specifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals” contains additional information regarding posts and mounting.",
              "04 Section 2A.11 contains criteria for enhanced conspicuity of standard signs. 05 Sections 2A.15 and 2A.16 contain lateral and height placement criteria for signs placed on existing supports.",
              "02 Sign clutter is the proliferation of sign installations or assemblies along the roadway or roadside, either separately or grouped, to such an extent that adequate spacing between installations necessary for orderly processing of the sign messages by the driver cannot be achieved. Sign clutter can reduce the effectiveness of one or more signs in a sequence of signs. 03 The basic role of traffic control devices is to provide only as much information to the road user as necessary to promote the safe and efficient operation of streets and highways. Sign clutter can result from the overuse of MUTCD-compliant signs and or signs that display information unrelated to traffic operation, navigation, or transportation information. Examples of such signs would include, but are not limited to, those displaying the birthplace or home of a noted person, local sports team accomplishments, population information, and self- described qualities of a community such as “friendly” or “open for business.”",
              "05 Section 2A.13 contains information regarding an order of priority for signs where available spacing along the roadway is limited. Section 2A.21  Retroreflection and Illumination",
              "01 There are many materials currently available for retroreflection and various methods currently available for the illumination of signs and object markers. New materials and methods continue to emerge. New materials and methods can be used as long as the signs and object markers meet the standard requirements for color, both by day and by night. 02 This Section applies to visibility of signs at night or in low-light or adverse weather conditions, whose legends are otherwise visible under typical daytime viewing conditions.",

              "01 Retroreflectivity is one of several factors associated with maintaining nighttime sign visibility (see Section 2A.21).",
              "03 Compliance with the Standard in Paragraph 2 of this Section is achieved by having a method in place and using the method to maintain the minimum levels established in Table 2A-5. Provided that an assessment or management method is being used, an agency or official having jurisdiction would be in compliance with the Standard in Paragraph 2 of this Section even if there are some individual signs that do not meet the minimum retroreflectivity levels at a particular point in time.

              "04 Divided highway crossings with median widths between 30 feet and 85 feet might function as either one or two intersections depending upon the interaction of the opposing left-turn vehicle paths and the available interior storage in the median for a crossing vehicle. Other factors that could determine whether a divided highway crossing is operating as one or two intersections include: A.\t The geometric design of the divided highway crossing, B.\t The use of positive offset mainline left-turn lanes, C.\t The length of the median opening (as measured parallel to the center line of the divided highway), D.\t The geometric design of the median noses, E.\t Other roadway geometric considerations such as a skewed side street approach or a variable median width, F.\t Intersection sight distance, G.\t The physical characteristics of the design vehicle, and H.\t The observed prevailing driver behavior with regard to opposing left-turn path interaction. Section 2A.V1  Integrated Directional Signing Program (IDSP)",
              "01 The Integrated Directional Signing Program (IDSP) provides Virginia motorist service businesses, attractions, tourist destinations, and other specific points of interest with a single contact for the purpose of having their logo/business identified on a road sign along VDOT-maintained roadways to provide motorists with directional guidance and information about their location. IDSP signs are installed, maintained, modified, and removed by the IDSP contractor. Additional information, such as the current contractor for the IDSP, can be found on VDOT’s IDSP website. 02 There are four main types of traffic control device signs that are included within the IDSP: A.\t Specific Service Signing – Specific Service Signs (Logo) provide the motorist directional guidance to the providers of Gas, Food, Lodging, Camping, and Attractions destinations near interchanges of limited access roadways. Additional information on Specific Service Signs can be found in Chapter 2J. B.\t Tourist-Oriented Directional Signing – Tourist-Oriented Directional Signs (TODS) guide motorists to tourist-oriented businesses, services, and activity facilities along rural primary and secondary highways that do not have limited access. Additional information on TODS can be found in Chapter 2K. C.\t Supplemental Guide Signing – Supplemental Guide Signs guide motorists to specific cultural, recreational, historical, governmental, educational, military, and other sites of similar interest from limited access, primary, and secondary roadways. This program excludes Supplemental Guide Signs for cities, towns, villages, counties, regions, communities, named roads/streets, transportation facilities, and other governmental entities, which are installed and maintained by VDOT (i.e. Charlottesville EXIT 221). Additional information on Supplemental Guide Signs covered under the IDSP can be found in Sections 2E.51 and 2M.09. D.\t General Motorist Service Signing – General Motorist Service Signs (GMSS) use symbols to inform the motorists of the availability of motorist services.

Signs January 2026 GENERAL Section 2B.01  Application of Regulatory Signs",
              "02 The use of educational plaques to supplement symbol signs is described in Section 2A.09. 03 The use of LEDs in the border or legend of regulatory signs is described in Section 2A.12.",
              "02 Section 2A.07 contains information regarding the applicability of the various columns in Table 2B-1(VA).",
              "06 The use of the CROSS TRAFFIC DOES NOT STOP (W4-4P series) and other plaques with variations of this legend is described in Section 2C.66.",
              "09 The design and application of Stop Beacons are described in Section 4S.05. Section 2B.05  YIELD Sign (R1-2)",
              "01 The YIELD sign requires road users to yield the right-of-way to other traffic on certain approaches to an intersection or on a two way approach to a one way section of roadway, such as a narrow bridge or underpass. Vehicles controlled by a YIELD sign need to slow down to a speed that is reasonable for the existing conditions or stop when necessary to avoid interfering with conflicting traffic.",
              "01 Unsignalized intersections represent the most common form of intersection right-of-way control. Selection of control type might be impacted by specific requirements of State law or local ordinances. 02 Roundabouts and traffic circles are circular intersection designs and are not traffic control devices. The decision to convert an intersection from a conventional intersection to a circular intersection is an engineering design decision and not a traffic control device decision. As such, criteria for conversion from a conventional intersection to a circular intersection are not included in the MUTCD.",
              "04 Some types of right-of-way control that can exist at an unsignalized intersection in order from the least restrictive to the most restrictive are the following: A.\t No intersection control (see Section 2B.09): There are no right-of-way traffic control devices on any of the approaches to the intersection. B.\t Yield control (see Section 2B.10): YIELD signs are placed on all approaches (for a circular intersection), on opposing approaches for a four-leg intersection, on a single approach for a three-leg intersection, or in the median of a divided highway. The YIELD signs are placed on the minor road. C.\t Minor road stop control (see Section 2B.11): STOP signs are typically placed on opposing approaches (for a four-leg intersection) or on a single approach (for a three-leg intersection). The STOP signs are normally placed on the minor road. Section 2B.07 contains guidance on selecting the minor road. D.\t All-way stop control (see Section 2B.12): STOP signs are placed on all approaches to the intersection.",
              "07 Appropriate traffic calming or other speed control measures are available to control vehicle speeds, such as those that do not have the potential to diminish the effectiveness of traffic control devices when used for their specified purpose.",
              "13 The use of STOP signs at grade crossings is described in Sections 8B.04 and 8B.05. 14 Section 9B.01 contains provisions regarding the assignment of priority where a shared-use path crosses a roadway. Section 2B.07  Determining the Minor Road for Unsignalized Intersections",
              "01 The provisions in the following sections describe warrants for the recommended engineering study to determine all-way stop control. Warrants are not a substitute for engineering judgment. The fact that a warrant for a particular traffic control device is met is not conclusive justification to install or not install all-way stop control. Because each intersection will have unique characteristics that affect its operational performance or safety, it is the engineering study for a given intersection that is ultimately the basis for a decision to install or not install all- way stop control. 02 All-way stop controls at intersections with substantially differing approach volumes can reduce the effectiveness of these devices for all roadway users.",
              "02 At such a location, a road user, after stopping, cannot see conflicting traffic and is not able to negotiate the intersection unless conflicting cross traffic is also required to stop. Section 2B.15  All-Way Stop Control Warrant C: Transition to Signal Control or Transition to Yield Control at a Circular Intersection",
              "01b At intersections of roadways of equal importance, heavier volume usage can occur on the approaches of one roadway for part of the day and on the approaches of the other roadway for another part of the day.",

              "01 In general, the maximum speed limits applicable to rural and urban roads are established: A.\t Statutorily – a maximum speed limit applicable to a particular class of road, such as freeways or city streets, that is established by State law; or B.\t As speed zones – based on engineering studies. 02 State statutory limits might restrict the maximum speed limit that can be established on a particular road, notwithstanding what an engineering study might indicate. 03 Agencies with designated authorities to set speed limits, which include States, and sometimes local jurisdictions, can establish non-statutory speed limits or designate reduced speed zones using an engineering study. Setting appropriate speed limits is especially important to ensure safety for all road users in varying types of contexts, particularly on roadways where adjacent land use suggests that trips could be served by varied modes. These situations include urban and suburban non-freeway arterials or rural arterials that serve as main streets in smaller communities, consistent with the context classifications of urban core, urban, suburban, and rural towns found in “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,” 2018 Edition, AASHTO. When setting a speed limit, a range of factors such as land-use context, pedestrian and bicyclist activity, crash history, intersection spacing, driveway density, roadway geometry, roadside conditions, roadway functional classification, traffic volume, and observed speeds can influence the speed limit determined in the engineering study. The engineering study will determine which of the recommended factors will prevail in setting the speed limit. 04 Jurisdictions can use speed limit setting tools and methods such as expert systems and those consistent with the safe system approach as part of the required engineering study for a non-statutory speed limit. As speed limit setting tools vary, jurisdictions need to be aware of their limitations and advantages, possible variation between the tools and the need to explore gaps or weaknesses of tools, and weigh the output accordingly in consideration of setting speed limits. 05 To achieve desired operating speeds, agencies often implement other speed management strategies concurrently with setting speed limits, such as traffic calming measures, geometric design features, speed safety cameras, and increased enforcement.",

Letter heights for mixed-case \nlegends might be expressed in terms of both the upper- and lower-case letters, or in terms of the initial upper-\ncase letter alone. When the height of a lower-case letter is specified or determined from the prescribed ratio, the \nreference is to the nominal loop height of the letter.

Therefore, this Manual sometimes includes the practice of using educational plaques to accompany \nnew symbol signs.\nGuidance:\n06\t\t\nNew standard warning or regulatory symbol signs should be accompanied by an educational plaque where \nengineering judgment determines that the plaque will improve road user comprehension during the transition \nfrom word message to symbol signs.\nOption:\n07\t\t\nEducational plaques may be left in place as long as they are in serviceable condition.\nStandard:\n08\t\t\nA symbol used for a given category of signs (regulatory, warning, or guide) shall not be used for a \ndifferent category of signs, except as specifically authorized in this Manual.\n09\t\t\nA recreational and cultural interest area symbol (see Chapter 2M) shall not be used on streets or \nhighways outside of recreational and cultural interest areas.\n10\t\t\nA recreational and cultural interest area symbol (see Chapter 2M) shall not be used on any regulatory \nor warning sign on any street, road, or highway.\nSupport:\n11\t\t\nSection 2M.07 contains provisions for the use of recreational and cultural interest area symbols to indicate \nprohibited activities or items in non-road applications. \nSection 2A.10  Sign Borders\nStandard:\n01\t\t\nUnless otherwise provided, signs shall have a border of the same color as the legend in order to outline \ntheir distinctive shape and thereby give them easy recognition and a finished appearance.\n02\t\t\nThe corners of all sign borders shall be rounded, except for STOP signs.\nGuidance:\n03\t\t\nA dark border on a light background should be set in from the edge, while a light border on a dark \nbackground should extend to the edge of the sign.

The distances for Condition B (with the exception of the potential stop condition) have been adjusted for a sign legibility distance of 250 feet, which is appropriate for an alignment warning symbol sign. For Conditions A and B, warning signs with less than 6-inch legend or more than four words, a minimum of 100 feet should be added to the advance placement distance to provide adequate legibility of the warning sign. 2 \u0007Typical conditions are locations where the road user must use extra time to adjust speed and change lanes in heavy traffic because of a complex driving situation. Typical signs are Merge and Right Lane Ends. The distances are determined by providing the driver a PRT of 14.0 to 14.5 seconds for vehicle maneuvers (2018 AASHTO Policy, Table 3-3, Decision Sight Distance, Avoidance Maneuver E) and adjusted for a legibility distance of 180 feet for the appropriate sign. 3 \u0007Typical condition is the warning of a potential stop situation. Typical signs are Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead, Signal Ahead, and Intersection Warning signs. The distances are based on the 2018 AASHTO Policy, Table 3-1, Stopping Sight Distance, providing a PRT of 2.5 seconds, a deceleration rate of 11.2 feet/second2. 4 \u0007Typical conditions are locations where the road user must decrease speed to maneuver through the warned condition. Typical signs are Turn, Curve, Reverse Turn, or Reverse Curve. The distance is determined by providing a 2.5 second PRT, a vehicle deceleration rate of 10 feet/second2, and adjusted for a sign legibility distance of 250 feet. 5 \u0007No suggested distances are provided for these speeds, as the placement location is dependent on site conditions and other signing. An alignment warning sign may be placed anywhere from the point of curvature up to 100 feet in advance of the curve. However, the alignment warning sign should be installed in advance of the curve and at least 100 feet from any other signs. 6 \u0007The minimum advance placement distance is listed as 100 feet to provide adequate spacing between signs. Note: \u0007Warning signs that advise road users about conditions that are not related to a specific location, such as Deer Crossing or SOFT SHOULDER, can be installed in an appropriate location, based on engineering judgment.

              "01 A variety of horizontal alignment warning signs (see Figure 2C-1), pavement markings (see Chapter 3B), and delineation (see Chapter 3G) can be used to advise motorists of a change in the roadway alignment. Uniform application of these traffic control devices with respect to the amount of change in the roadway alignment conveys a consistent message establishing driver expectancy and promoting effective roadway operations.

Longer commonly used words that are not part of a proper name and are readily recognizable, \nsuch as street name descriptors (such as Street, Boulevard, or Avenue), should be abbreviated as provided in \nTable 2D-3 to expedite recognition of the sign legend by reducing the amount and complexity of the legend. \nShorter street name descriptors, such as those shown in Table 2D-4, should not be abbreviated.\n04\t\t\nPeriods, apostrophes, question marks, ampersands, or other punctuation or characters that are not letters, \nnumerals, or hyphens should not be used in abbreviations, unless necessary to avoid confusion.\n05\t\t\nThe solidus is intended to be used for fractions only and should not be used to separate words on the same \nline of legend. Instead, a hyphen should be used for this purpose, such as “TRUCKS – BUSES.”"

Such signs should be located as far as practicable from the street, such as at the far edge of the sidewalk. Where locating such signs farther from the roadway is impracticable, the pedestrian wayfinding signs should have their conspicuity to vehicular traffic minimized by employing one or a combination of the following methods: A.\t Locating signs away from intersections where high-priority traffic control devices are present. B.\t Facing the pedestrian message toward the sidewalk and away from the street. C.\t Cantilevering the sign over the sidewalk if the pedestrian wayfinding sign is mounted at a height consistent with vehicular traffic signs, removing the pedestrian wayfinding signs from the line of sight in a sequence of vehicular signs.

Community \nwayfinding guide signs shall not be installed on freeway or expressway mainlines or ramps. Direction \nto community wayfinding destinations from a freeway or expressway shall be limited to the use of a \nSupplemental guide sign (see Section 2E.51) on the mainline and a Destination sign (see Section 2D.36) \non the ramp to direct road users to the area or areas within which community wayfinding guide signs \nare used. The individual wayfinding destinations shall not be displayed on the Supplemental guide and \nDestination signs except where the destinations are in accordance with the State or agency policy on \nSupplemental guide signs.\n05\t\t\nCommunity wayfinding guide signs shall not be used to provide direction to primary destinations \nor highway routes or streets. Destination or other guide signs shall be used for this purpose as described \nelsewhere in this Chapter and shall have priority over any community wayfinding sign in placement, \nprominence, and conspicuity.\n06\t\t\nBecause regulatory, warning, and other guide signs have a higher priority, community wayfinding \nguide signs shall not be installed where adequate spacing cannot be provided between the community \nwayfinding guide sign and other higher-priority signs. Community wayfinding guide signs shall not be \ninstalled in a position where they would obscure the road users’ view of other traffic control devices.\n07\t\t\nCommunity wayfinding guide signs shall not be mounted overhead.\nGuidance:\n08\t\t\nIf used, a community wayfinding guide sign system should be established on a local municipal or equivalent \njurisdictional level or for an urbanized area of adjoining municipalities or equivalent that form an identifiable \ngeographic entity that is conducive to a cohesive and continuous system of signs. Community wayfinding \nguide signs should not be used on a regional or statewide basis where infrequent or sparse placement does not \ncontribute to a continuous or coordinated system of signing that is readily identifiable as such to the road user. \nIn such cases, Destination or other guide signs detailed in this Chapter should be used to direct road users to an \nidentifiable area in which the type of eligible destination described in Paragraph 1 of this Section is located.\n09\t\t\nWhen a system of community wayfinding guide signs is being considered, the system of existing guide signs \nshould be evaluated for applicability and general compliance with the provisions of this Manual to ensure \nroad user directional guidance is adequately being addressed.\nFigure 2D-30.

Where \nlocating such signs farther from the roadway is impracticable, the pedestrian wayfinding signs should have their \nconspicuity to vehicular traffic minimized by employing one or a combination of the following methods:\nA.\t Locating signs away from intersections where high-priority traffic control devices are present.\nB.\t Facing the pedestrian message toward the sidewalk and away from the street.\nC.\t Cantilevering the sign over the sidewalk if the pedestrian wayfinding sign is mounted at a height \nconsistent with vehicular traffic signs, removing the pedestrian wayfinding signs from the line of sight in \na sequence of vehicular signs.\nFigure 2D-31.

National Historic Trail Identification (M11-1) signs (see Figure 2D-34) may be installed in a Directional or \nConfirming assembly with a HISTORIC ROUTE (M11-1aP), CROSSING (M11-1bP), or AUTO TOUR ROUTE \n(M11-1cP) auxiliary plaque (see Figure 2D-34) mounted below the M11-1 sign. The beginning and end of a \nhistoric trail route or auto tour route may be indicated with a BEGIN (M4-14P) or END (M4-6P) auxiliary plaque \n(see Figure 2D-5(VA)) with a white legend and border on a brown background mounted above the historic trail \nidentification sign. The length of the route may be identified by a NEXT XX MILES (M11-1dP) auxiliary plaque \nmounted below the M11-1aP or M11-1cP auxiliary plaque.\nGuidance:\n10\t\t\nThe design and size of historic trail and State scenic byway identification or system signs should comply with \nthe general provisions and principles for route signs (see Section 2D.10). Designs should be simple, dignified, \nand devoid of complex graphics. The size of the signs should not exceed the size of the route signs used along a \nparticular route.\nStandard:\n11\t\t\nScenic byway, historic trail, and auto tour route sign designs shall not have a similar design to or \nresemble a highway route sign.\nGuidance:\n12\t\t\nWhere used, historic trail and State scenic byway identification signs should be installed as Directional \n(see Section 2D.32) or Confirming (see Section 2D.33) assemblies at independent locations, separate from other \nRoute Sign assemblies and Destination guide signs.

If an auto tour route has been \ndesignated along other highways to provide access to sites along the original trail as described in Paragraph 13 \nof this Section, then the signing should be limited to Destination signs for those sites and directional signing to \naccess the original route of the trail.

Instead, \ndirection along the auto tour route should rely on the touring map and other directional signs for the highways \nthat the auto tour route follows.\nStandard:\n16\t\t\nIdentification signs for historic trails, auto tour routes, and scenic byways shall not be installed on \nfreeways or expressways, except as necessary to provide continuity between discontinuous segments of \nconventional roadways that are designated as a trail, auto tour route, or byway, for which the freeway or \nexpressway provides the only connection between the segments. If installed on freeways or expressways, the \nidentification signs shall be installed as independent trailblazer assemblies (see Sections 2D.34 and 2E.55) \nand shall not be installed with other route signs or Confirming assemblies or on guide signs. If installed \non freeways or expressways, the trailblazer assemblies for the trail, auto tour route, or byway shall be \ninstalled at less frequent intervals than Confirming assemblies for the highway route.\n17\t\t\nIdentification signs for historic trails, auto tour routes, and scenic byways shall not be installed as sign \npanels on a guide sign or as part of a guide sign assembly.\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 311\nPart 2.

              "01 Many roadways within airport facilities (including terminal curbside roadways) are considered to be conventional roads because they typically have frequent driveways and at-grade intersections and might have pedestrian activity along and/or across them. 02 Some airport roadways have full or partial control of access and operating speeds higher than 45 mph and thus would be classified as freeways or expressways for signing purposes (see Chapter 2E). Freeway or expressway conditions typically exist on the approaches to the airport from other highways; on the approaches to access points to terminals, parking, and other patron facilities; and on roadways that provide exits from the airport facility to connect with the local or regional highway network. 03 Roadways within airports and other similarly-contained roadway networks with multiple closely-spaced access points to multiple destinations (such as terminals, parking facilities, rental car facilities, and other airport services) often present challenges for the application of guide signing. Closely-spaced signs, excessive sign messaging either co-located or in succession, and the resulting excessive informational load imposed on the road user are of particular concern for such roadways. The Transportation Research Board’s Airport Cooperative Research Program Report 52, “Wayfinding and Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminal and Landside,” contains additional information on the application of traffic control devices to the unique geometrics and roadway environment that are typical of airports. 04 An example of major guide signing on the approaches to and within an airport facility roadway network is shown in Figure 2D-39.",

The Transportation Research Board’s Airport Cooperative \nResearch Program Report 52, “Wayfinding and Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminal and Landside,” contains \nadditional information on the application of traffic control devices to the unique geometrics and roadway \nenvironment that are typical of airports.\n04\t\t\nAn example of major guide signing on the approaches to and within an airport facility roadway network is \nshown in Figure 2D-39.\nGuidance:\n05\t\t\nIf adequate sign spacing cannot be provided due to the site and roadway characteristics of an airport or \nsimilar facility, then measures should be taken to reduce the speeds of vehicles on the roadway to provide road \nusers with adequate time to comprehend and respond to the sign messages. Consideration should also be given to \nincreasing the sign letter heights to provide greater viewing distances and decision times. Where a single terminal \nserves a large number of airlines, the airline information should be displayed on separate signs that appear in \nsequence to limit the number of airlines displayed on a single sign or at a single location. Changeable message \nsigns (see Chapter 2L) should not be used to rotate the display of airlines to an approaching road user.\nSupport:\n06\t\t\nThere are various methods that can be used to help reduce vehicle speeds, including roadway geometric \nchanges, implementing traffic calming measures, and increased enforcement. Provisions on setting speed limits \nare found in Section 2B.21.\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 317\nPart 2.

          "raw_text": "Support:\n01\t\t\nIndependent facilities or areas have been \nadded along many highways where certain \ncommercial vehicles are directed to stop to be weighed or inspected. These areas are sometimes permanent, such \nas in a roadside area, or temporary mobile facilities deployed along the roadway.\n02\t\t\nThe general concept for signing permanent Weigh Stations is similar to Rest Area signing (see Section 2I.05) \nbecause in both cases traffic using either area remains within the highway right-of-way.\nStandard:\n03\t\t\nThe standard sequence of signs for a Weigh Station on an expressway or freeway shall include four \nbasic signs (see Figure 2E-59):\nA.\t An Advance Weigh Station Distance (D8-1) sign with the distance 1 MILE displayed,\nB.\t An Advance Weigh Station Distance (D8-1) sign with the distance ½ MILE displayed, or a Weigh \nStation Advance Direction (D8-2) sign,\nC.\t A Weigh Station Entrance Direction (D8-3) sign, and\nD.\t A Weigh Station Gore sign (with the same legend as the Entrance Direction (D8-3) sign).\nOption:\n04\t\t\nWhen spacing of 1 mile and ½ mile are not practical for the D8-1 signs, the 1 MILE and ½ MILE distances \non the D8-1 signs may be adjusted to match the spacing determined by engineering judgment.\n05\t\t\nWhere State law requires trucks of a certain weight to enter the weigh station, a Weigh Station (R13-1) \nregulatory sign (see Section 2B.65) may be added to the sign sequence as shown in Figure 2E-59.\n06\t\t\nWhere only commercial vehicle inspections are conducted in the inspection area and vehicles are not \nweighed, the WEIGH STATION legend of the D8 series signs may be replaced with the alternate legend, \nCOMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTION AREA.\nStandard:\n07\t\t\nWhen the WEIGH STATION legend of the D8 series signs is replaced with COMMERCIAL \nVEHICLE INSPECTION AREA legend as provided for in Paragraph 6 of this Section, the WEIGH \nSTATION legend of the R13-1 sign shall be replaced with the alternate legend INSPECTION AREA.\n08\t\t\nA changeable legend display that displays either OPEN or CLOSED shall be included in the signing \nsequence to indicate when trucks are required to enter the weigh station.\nGuidance:\n09\t\t\nThe required changeable legend display OPEN or CLOSED describe in Paragraph 8 of this Section should \nbe displayed within and at the bottom of the Weigh Station Advance Direction (D8-2) sign or the Advance Weigh \nStation Distance (D8-1) sign, or on a supplemental plaque or sign panel.\nOption:\n10\t\t\nA plaque with the legend OPEN WHEN FLASHING may be added to one of the Advance Weigh Station \nDistance signs along with associated flashing beacons, in place of the changeable legend OPEN or CLOSED sign, \nto indicate when commercial vehicles are required to enter the weigh station.\nSupport:\n11\t\t\nWeigh Station Area sign layouts for freeway and expressway applications are shown in the “Standard \nHighway Signs” publication (see Section 1A.05).

The aspect of tolling and the presence of toll plazas or collection points necessitate additional considerations \nin the typical signing needs. The notification of the collection of tolls in advance of and at entry points to the toll \nhighway also necessitates additional modifications to the typical signing.\n02\t\t\nThe scope of this Section applies to a route or facility on which all lanes are tolled. Chapter 2G contains \nprovisions for the signing of managed lanes within an otherwise non-toll facility that employ tolling or pricing as \nan operational strategy to manage congestion levels.\nStandard:\n03\t\t\nExcept where specifically provided in this Chapter, the provisions of other Chapters in Part 2 shall \napply to toll roads."

              "01 Preferential lanes are lanes designated for special traffic uses such as high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), light rail, buses, or taxis. Preferential lane treatments might be as simple as restricting a turning lane to a certain class of vehicles during peak periods, or as sophisticated as providing a separate roadway system within a highway corridor for certain vehicles. 02 Preferential lanes might be barrier-separated (on a separate alignment or physically separated from the other travel lanes by a barrier or median), buffer-separated (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a narrow buffer area created with longitudinal pavement markings), or contiguous (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a lane line). Preferential lanes might allow continuous access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes or restrict access only to designated locations. Preferential lanes might be operated in a constant direction or operated as reversible lanes. Some reversible preferential lanes on a divided highway might be operated counter-flow to the direction of traffic on the immediately adjacent general-purpose lanes. 03 Preferential lanes might be operated on a 24-hour basis, for extended periods of the day, during peak travel periods only, during special events, or during other activities. 04 Open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes that segregate traffic based on payment method are not considered preferential lanes. Chapter 2F contains information regarding signing of open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes. 05 Managed lanes typically restrict access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes to designated locations only. 06 Under certain operational strategies, such as the occupancy requirement of an HOV lane changing in response to actual congestion levels, a managed lane is a special type of preferential lane (see Sections 2G.03 through 2G.07). 07 A managed lane operated on a real-time basis in response to changing conditions might be operated as an HOV lane for a period of time as needed to manage congestion levels. 08 Sections 2G.17 through 2G.19 contain additional information regarding signs for managed lanes that use tolling or pricing as a management strategy. 09 Section 9B.04 contains information regarding Preferential Lane signs for bicycle lanes."

              "01 A priced managed lane is a managed lane that employs tolling or pricing, typically through electronic toll collection, to manage congestion levels and maintain a certain level of service for users of the facility.

Some CMS have a blank mode when no message is displayed, while others display multiple messages with only one of the messages displayed at a time (such as OPEN/CLOSED signs at weigh stations). 02 The provisions in this Chapter apply to both permanent and portable changeable message signs with electronic displays or the electronic display portion of an otherwise conventional static sign. Additional provisions that only apply to portable changeable message signs (PCMS) can be found in Section 6L.05 the VWAPM. The provisions in this Chapter generally do not apply to CMS with non-electronic displays that are changed either manually or electromechanically, such as a hinged-panel, rotating-drum, or back-lit curtain or scroll CMS. 03 The CMS is a traffic control device at all times regardless of the type of message being displayed. Accordingly, the limitations on design, format, and manner of display of a message conveyed on a conventional sign apply to CMS regardless of the type of message being displayed at any given time. Some of the general provisions regarding traffic control devices are reiterated in this Chapter. However, this Chapter is not an independent or stand-alone reference for CMS. Users of CMS are expected to consult the other chapters in this Manual for criteria on how to develop effective messages that comply with this Manual and that meet the expectancy and limitations of the road user. In this regard, the engineering processes applied to decisions about whether to use a particular sign, for example, are no different for the decisions about the type and content of the message under consideration for display on a CMS. The other limited-use messages allowed on CMS as provided for in this Chapter likewise fall under the same MUTCD provisions as the primary-use traffic operation regulatory, warning, and guidance messages except as stated otherwise in this Chapter. 04 CMS messaging can be subject to habituation, a phenomenon by which repeated exposure to a stimulus results in diminished response. CMS habituation can occur through repeated exposure to messages, especially those messages that might not be perceived as having relevance to the road user, resulting in diminished responsiveness of the road user to that message. Because messages can be changed or extinguished, the effectiveness of CMS is tied more to the messages displayed thereon, the frequency of displayed messages, and the relevance to the road user, rather than to the installation of the signs themselves."

Figure 2L-1 shows comparative examples of the effects of varying pixel densities on legend form.\nGuidance:\n24\t\t\nIf used, the CMS described in Paragraph 23 of this Section should not display symbols or route shields unless \nthey can do so in the appropriate legend and background color combinations. Where an LED matrix is used \nto form the changeable legend, signs with pixel spacing greater than 20 millimeters should display only word \nlegends and no symbols or route shields.\n25\t\t\nFor a single-phase message where the Standard Alphabets and other legend elements of standard designs are \nused, the lettering style, size, and line spacing should comply with the applicable provisions for the type of message \ndisplayed as provided elsewhere in this Manual. For two-phase messages, larger legend heights should be used \nas described previously in this Section because of the need for such messages to be legible at a greater distance. \nRegardless of the number of phases, the CMS should comply with the legibility and visibility provisions of Section 2L.03."
