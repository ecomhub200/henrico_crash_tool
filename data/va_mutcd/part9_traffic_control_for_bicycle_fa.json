              "01 Part 9 covers signs and pavement markings specifically related to bicycle operation on roadways, separated bikeways, and shared-use paths. In jurisdictions where small, low-speed, human or electric-powered transportation devices (often referred to as a micromobility devices) are allowed to use bicycle facilities, they can be regulated by signs, pavement markings, and other traffic control devices related to bicycle operations, where allowed by law. Part 4 contains information on highway traffic signals and bicycle signal faces. Part 6 The VWAPM contains information on work zones for bicycle facilities and the mitigation of impacts to bicycle travel through work zones. 02 Definitions and acronyms pertaining to Part 9 are provided in Sections 1C.02 and 1C.03. 03 When operating on a roadway, bicycles are typically defined as vehicles and the operator of a bicycle is given the same rights and duties as an operator of a motor vehicle. Bicyclists are also vulnerable road users who have little to no protection from crash forces. 04 Designing bicycle facilities and the traffic control devices on those facilities in a manner that encourages predictable behavior and compliance with traffic laws from all roadway users can improve safety and increase public acceptance of bicyclists from other road users. The misuse of traffic control devices for improperly designed bicycle facilities or non-uniform applications can produce ineffective or counterproductive results. Section 1D.01 provides more information on the importance of uniformity of traffic control devices. 04a This Manual is for the purpose of establishing national and state standards for traffic control devices in Virginia on any roadways, bikeways, and shared-use-paths open to public travel. It is not intended to create policy on the geometric design of roadways or facility selection decisions. On VDOT-maintained roadways, facility selection decisions are made through policies and procedures implemented by VDOT’s Location and Design Division. As per VDOT’s project development process, Traffic Operations staff are included on project teams and are to be active members of teams making such facility selection decisions. After the geometric design decisions are made, those applying this Manual can select the most appropriate traffic control devices for the designed facility. 04b Most bicycle facility signs and markings are shown in this Manual as “if used”, meaning that the Standards, Guidance, and Options governing a device only apply after a decision has been made to install a particular device. Nothing in this Manual is intended to require the use of a specific device where it does not fit with the intended design of the facility. 05 The “Bikeway Selection Guide” (FHWA-SA-18-077), FHWA, provides information on the designs and configuration of bicycle facilities.",

Providing a physical \nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nPart 9. Traffic Control for Bicycle Facilities\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\t\nPage 949\nJanuary 2026\nseparation between a bicycle lane and a general-purpose lane can reduce vehicle encroachment into the bicycle lane \nbeyond a marked buffer alone and can in some cases prevent that encroachment altogether.\n02\t\t\nPhysical separation between general-purpose lanes and bicycle lanes introduces additional design considerations \nover buffer-separated bicycle lanes, including the awareness of a potentially unexpected conflict point for turning \nmotor vehicles and the provision of adequate sight distance for all users at intersections and driveway crossings.\nOption:\n03\t\t\nVertical elements used to provide physical separation between general-purpose lanes and bicycle lanes may \ninclude, but are not limited to, tubular markers, raised islands, or parked vehicles.\nSupport:\n04\t\t\nWhere on-street parking is provided adjacent to the buffer area of a separated bicycle lane, pedestrians will \nneed to access those vehicles.\nGuidance:\n05\t\t\nBIKE LANE (R3-17) signs (see Figure 9B-1) should be used to distinguish a separated bicycle lane from a \ngeneral-purpose lane.\n06\t\t\nWhere an on-street parking lane serves as the separation between a general-purpose lane and a separated \nbicycle lane, a buffer space should be provided between the parking lane and the bicycle lane to allow for \nopening doors of parked vehicles.\nSupport:\n07\t\t\nSeparated bicycle lanes may be designed for one-way or two-way bicycle travel. Providing one-way separated \nbicycle lanes in the same direction as and on the right-hand side of the general-purpose lane, whether on a one-\nway or two-way roadway, accommodates the expectations of road users and might result in fewer conflict points \nat intersections or driveway crossings.\nOption:\n08\t\t\nSeparated bicycle lanes may be provided on one or both sides of a roadway or in a center median.\nSupport:\n09\t\t\nThe presence of two-way separated bicycle lanes on one side of a roadway or in a center median can \nintroduce additional challenges and conflict points, which can warrant additional design considerations when \nselecting the design for a separated bicycle lane. These considerations include design requirements for pedestrians \nwho would interact with the separated bicycle lane.\nStandard:\n10\t\t\nThe edge line and lane line colors used for separated bicycle lanes shall conform to the requirements in \nChapter 3A (see Figure 9E-7).\n11\t\t\nDirectional arrows shall be used in conjunction with the bicycle lane symbol or word marking in \nseparated bicycle lanes, placed downstream from the symbol or word marking.\n12\t\t\nTurns on red shall be prohibited across separated bicycle lanes while bicyclists are allowed to proceed \nthrough the intersection.\nSupport:\n13\t\t\nAdditional information on signals for bicycle facilities is found in Chapter 4H.\n13a\t\nAs of the date of publication of the Virginia MUTCD, the Code of Virginia does not support the use of signal \nfaces specifically for bicycles. Content related to the design and operation of bicycle signals has been retained in \nthe Virginia MUTCD to support uniform application of bicycle signals in the event they are applied in the future. \nStandard:\n14\t\t\nThe buffer space for a separated bicycle lane shall be marked with solid longitudinal lines.\n15\t\t\nA marked buffer space that is 2 feet or wider for a separated bicycle lane, including those buffer spaces \nwhere tubular markers are provided, shall use chevron or diagonal markings within the buffer, unless \nphysical separation is provided that occupies the majority of the buffer space, such as raised islands or other \nphysical dividers, or such as where an on-street parking lane occupies the majority of the buffer space.\nGuidance:\n16\t\t\nWhere used in the buffer area of a separated bicycle lane, the spacing of chevrons or diagonal markings \nshould be 10 feet or greater.\n17\t\t\nCrosswalks that cross a separated bicycle lane should be marked consistent with the style of crosswalk \nmarking provided across the adjacent general-purpose lane.\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\nPart 9.
