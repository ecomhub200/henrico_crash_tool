Unless otherwise provided in the text or on a figure or table, the provisions of Part 8 are applicable to both highway-rail and highway-LRT grade crossings. Where the phrase “grade crossing” is used by itself without the prefix “highway-rail” or “highway-LRT,” it refers to both highway-rail and highway-LRT grade crossings. 03 Chapter 8E describes the traffic control devices that are used at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings. 04 Traffic control for grade crossings includes all signs, signals, markings, other warning devices, and their supports along highways approaching and at grade crossings. The function of this traffic control is to promote safety and provide effective operation of rail and/or LRT and highway traffic at grade crossings. 05 For purposes of design, installation, operation, and maintenance of traffic control devices at grade crossings, it is recognized that the crossing of the highway and rail tracks is situated on a right-of-way available for the joint use of both highway traffic and railroad or LRT traffic. 06 Grade crossings and the traffic control devices that are associated with them are unique in that in many cases, the highway agency or authority with jurisdiction, the regulatory agency with statutory authority (if applicable), and the railroad company or transit agency are jointly involved in the development of engineering judgment or the performance of an engineering study. This joint process is accomplished through the efforts of a Diagnostic Team made up of the highway agency with jurisdiction, the regulatory agency with statutory authority (if applicable), and the railroad company and/or transit agency (if applicable). 07 In Part 8, the combination of traffic control devices selected or installed at a specific grade crossing is referred to as a “traffic control system.” 08 The combination of railroad or LRT active traffic control devices used to inform road users at a grade crossing of the approach or presence of rail traffic and the necessary control equipment for the devices are referred to as a “grade crossing warning system.” The “2023 AREMA Communications and Signals Manual” published by the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) contains further information about grade crossing warning systems.",

              "01 Part 8 also describes the traffic control devices that are used in locations where light rail transit (LRT) vehicles are operating along streets and highways in mixed traffic with road users. 02 LRT is a mode of public transportation that employs LRT vehicles (commonly known as light rail vehicles, streetcars, or trolleys) that operate on rails in streets in mixed traffic, and LRT traffic that operates in semi- exclusive rights-of-way, or in exclusive rights-of-way. Where the phrase “LRT” is used in Part 8, it refers to light rail vehicles, streetcars, and trolleys. Grade crossings with LRT can occur at intersections or at midblock locations, including public and private driveways. 03 An initial educational campaign along with an ongoing program to continue to educate new drivers is beneficial when introducing LRT operations to an area and, hence, new traffic control devices. 04 LRT alignments can be grouped into one of the following three types (see definitions in Section 1C.02): A.\t Exclusive: An LRT right-of-way that is grade-separated or protected by a fence or traffic barrier. Motor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles are prohibited within the right-of-way. This type of alignment does not have grade crossings and is not further addressed in Part 8. Final - Pending Approval  Part 8.

C.\t Mixed-use: An alignment where LRT operates in mixed traffic with all types of road users. In a mixed- use alignment, the light rail transit traffic does not have the right-of-way over other road users at grade crossings and intersections. If the LRT traffic is controlled by traffic control signals or LRT signal faces at an intersection with a roadway, the alignment is considered to be mixed-use even if some of the approaches to the intersection are used exclusively by LRT traffic."

The LOW GROUND CLEARANCE educational plaque shall remain in place for at \nleast 3 years after the initial installation of the W10-5 sign (see Section 2A.09).\n02a\t\nIf used, the Low Ground Clearance Grade Crossing (W10-5) warning sign and the LOW GROUND \nCLEARANCE (W10-5P) plaque shall be installed between the Advance Railroad Crossing sign (W10-1) \nand the crossbuck and as close as practical to the railroad right-of-way. \n02b\t\nIf the Low Ground Clearance Grade Crossing (W10-5) warning sign is used in advance of the grade \ncrossing, an additional Low Ground Clearance Grade Crossing (W10-5) warning sign and a LOW \nGROUND CLEARANCE (W10-5P) plaque shall be installed in advance of the last alternate route. \n02c\t\nIf the Low Ground Clearance Grade Crossing (W10-5) warning sign is used in advance of the grade \ncrossing, an additional Low Ground Clearance Grade Crossing (W10-5) warning sign and a LOW \nGROUND CLEARANCE (W10-5P) plaque shall be installed a maximum of 150 feet past the alternate \nroute to alert traffic approaching from either direction on the alternate route. \nGuidance: \n02d\t\nEngineering judgement should be used to determine the most effective placement of the sign in Paragraph 2c. \nIn lieu of past the alternate route, signs could be placed on the intersecting route approaches. \n02e\t\nOn highways where the intersection of the last alternate route is via an interchange, signs should be installed \non the alternate route for both directions. \n02f\t\nA sign should be installed at intersection locations of other roadways existing between the last alternate \nroute and the crossing that will generate traffic that may have low ground clearance characteristics.\n03\t\t\nBecause other vehicle types and combinations also face the potential risk of hanging up at a grade \ncrossing, word message warning signs and selective exclusion regulatory signs (see Section 2B.45) for specific \nvehicle types and combinations should be used in addition to, or in place of, the Low Ground Clearance Grade \nCrossing (W10-5) sign. \nSupport:\n04\t\t\nWhile not all inclusive, some potential low ground clearance vehicles and combinations include single-unit \ntrucks, buses, motor coaches, low-boy trailers, car carriers, and recreational vehicles.\nGuidance:\n05\t\t\nAuxiliary plaques such as AHEAD, NEXT CROSSING, or USE NEXT CROSSING (with appropriate arrows), \nor a supplemental distance plaque should be placed below the W10-5 sign at the nearest intersecting highway \nwhere a vehicle can detour or at a point on the highway wide enough to permit a U-turn.\n06\t\t\nIf engineering judgment of roadway geometric and operating conditions confirms that motor vehicle speeds \nacross the tracks should be below the posted speed limit, a W13-1P advisory speed plaque should be posted.\n07\t\t\nA signed detour should be installed to guide potential hang-up vehicles to alternate nearby crossings to avoid \nthe potential hang-up condition.\nSupport:\n08\t\t\nInformation on ground clearance requirements at grade crossings is available in the 2019 edition of the \n“American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association’s Engineering Manual,” or in “A Policy on \nGeometric Design of Highways and Streets,” 2018 Edition, AASHTO.\n09\t\t\nAn inventory of crossings with low ground clearance concerns, including a list of potential vehicle types that \ncould hang up on the crossing, can be useful in tracking locations of low ground clearance crossings.

The Diagnostic Team shall \ndetermine the signal indications displayed by the highway traffic signal faces that control movements across \nthe grade crossing in accordance with Section 4F.19 in order to avoid the display of signal indications that \nconflict with the flashing-light signals.\nGuidance:\n14\t\t\nWhere the flashing-light signals are in place at a grade crossing, the operation of any flashing yellow beacon \ninstalled within 50 feet of any rail should be considered by a Diagnostic Team to determine whether the operation \nof the beacon should be terminated during the approach and passage of rail traffic.\nStandard:\n15\t\t\nThe preemption special control mode shall be activated by a supervised preemption interconnection using \nfail-safe design principles between the control circuits of the grade crossing warning system and the traffic \nsignal controller unit. The approach of rail traffic to a grade crossing shall de-energize the interconnection \nor send a message via a fail-safe data communication protocol (such as the “IEEE Standard for the Interface \nBetween the Rail Subsystem and the Highway Subsystem at a Highway Rail Intersection,” 1570-2002 \n(R2008), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), which in turn shall activate the traffic signal \ncontroller preemption sequence.

Instead, the universal application of horizontally-aligned, \nalternately-flashing red lights is the uniform active traffic control device for all grade crossings where rail traffic \ndoes not stop including pathway and sidewalk grade crossings.\nStandard:\n02\t\t\nExcept as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Section, pedestrian signal heads as described in Chapter 4I \ncomprised of Upraised Hand and Walking Person symbols shall not be used at a pathway or sidewalk grade \ncrossing.\nOption:\n03\t\t\nPedestrian signal heads may be used at a pathway or sidewalk grade crossing where the movement of LRT \nvehicles is controlled by a traffic control signal or by special LRT signals (see Section 8D.15).\nStandard:\n04\t\t\nIf used at a pathway or sidewalk grade crossing, flashing-light signals shall be aligned horizontally and \nthe light units shall have a diameter of at least 4 inches. For 4-inch diameter light units, the light centers \nshall be spaced approximately 16 inches apart and, if used, the flashing light unit backgrounds shall be at \nleast 8 inches in diameter.\n05\t\t\nEach red signal unit in the flashing-light signal shall flash alternately. The number of flashes per minute \nfor each lamp shall be 35 minimum and 65 maximum. Each lamp shall be illuminated for approximately the \nsame length of time. The total time of illumination of each pair of lamps shall be the entire operating time.\n06\t\t\nThe minimum mounting height of the flashing-light signals shall be 4 feet, measured vertically from the \nbottom edge of the lights to the elevation of the near edge of the pathway or sidewalk surface.\nOption:\n07\t\t\nAt station, pathway, or sidewalk grade crossings with multiple tracks, traffic control devices may be installed \nbetween the tracks in compliance with any railroad clearance requirements.\nStandard:\n08\t\t\nThe mounting height for flashing-light signals that are installed between the tracks at multiple-track \ncrossings shall be a minimum of 1 foot, measured vertically from the bottom edge of the lights to the \nelevation of the near edge of the pathway surface.\nGuidance:\n09\t\t\nIf a Diagnostic Team finds that a flashing-light signal with a Crossbuck sign and an audible device is still \nnot resulting in appropriate pedestrian behavior, consideration should be given to also installing an automatic \npedestrian gate (see Section 8E.09).\n10\t\t\nFlashing-light signals (see Figure 8E-7) with a Crossbuck (R15-1) sign and an audible device should be \ninstalled along semi-exclusive LRT alignments at station, pathway, or sidewalk grade crossings where the \nDiagnostic Team has determined that the sight distance is not sufficient for pathway or sidewalk users to \ncomplete their crossing prior to the arrival of LRT traffic at the crossing.\n11\t\t\nIf the Diagnostic Team determines that flashing-light signals with a Crossbuck sign and an audible device \nwould not provide sufficient notice of approaching LRT traffic, consideration should be given to also installing \nan automatic pedestrian gate (see Section 8E.09) with appropriate channelization or fencing."
