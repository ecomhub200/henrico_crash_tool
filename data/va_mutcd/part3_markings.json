          "raw_text": "Support:\n01\t\t\nSidewalk extensions reclaim a portion of the roadway, sometimes including a portion of parking lanes, \nshoulders, and/or the traveled way, and repurpose that area for non-vehicular uses. They extend the sidewalk or \nother pedestrian space, shorten pedestrian crossing distances, alter the roadway geometry for speed management \nor channelizing, or serve other purposes. \n02\t\t\nSidewalk extensions, sometimes referred to as curb extensions, neckdowns, or bulb-outs, typically are created \nby physical infrastructure including concrete or asphalt to form a physical narrowing of the roadway with the \nfinished surface at the same level as the adjoining sidewalk. \n03\t\t\nSidewalk extensions can also be designated by pavement markings for temporary or semi-permanent \napplications in which the finished surface is at the same level as the vehicular travel pavement. Where an \nadjoining curb and raised sidewalk are present, this type of application results in a multi-level sidewalk due to the \ndifference in elevation between the adjoining pedestrian surfaces.\n04\t\t\nSidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings differ from other paved areas designated by pavement \nmarkings that are intended to be traversable by a vehicle for authorized or emergency purposes.\nStandard:\n05\t\t\nSidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings shall be established using double solid lines \nconnecting to the outside physical curb or, in the absence of a curb, to the edge of the roadway. The color \nof the double solid line shall comply with the provisions of Section 3A.03.\nSupport:\n06\t\t\nThe paved area between the double solid line forming the sidewalk extension designated by pavement \nmarkings and the sidewalk or other roadside area is not part of the roadway.

Markings\nPage 686\t\nVirginia MUTCD for Streets and Highways | Version 11.0\nJanuary 2026\nFinal - Pending \nApproval\n\npavement markings formed by double solid lines are distinct from areas such as shoulders or gore areas where \ntravel is discouraged by the presence of a single line, or flush medians where travel is prohibited by a double solid \nline. Sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings with double solid lines designate areas outside the \nroadway where vehicle traversal is prohibited.\n07\t\t\nAreas formed by a single wide line are sometimes used to alter the roadway geometry for speed management \nor channelizing, or to serve other purposes, where pedestrians are not expected (see Drawing B in Figure 3J-6). \nThese areas are not considered a sidewalk extension, and provisions to delineate areas where vehicle traversal is \ndiscouraged include channelizing lines (see Section 3B.08), edge lines (see Section 3B.09), and diagonal markings \n(see Section 3B.25).\nGuidance:\n08\t\t\nChannelizing devices such as tubular markers (see Chapter 3I) should be used to provide conspicuity for, and \nto prevent vehicles from traversing, the area of the sidewalk extension designated by pavement markings. They \nshould be located adjacent to the double solid line outside the traveled way.\nSupport:\n09\t\t\nWhen selecting other methods of physical separation, the visual contrast from adjoining pavement and \nmaximum separation distances are considerations so they are visible to pedestrians having limited vision and \ndetectable by pedestrians who travel with a long cane.\n10\t\t\nSight lines and the visibility of road users within the sidewalk extension area are considerations when \nselecting methods of physical separation.\n11\t\t\nThe swept path of turning design or other prevailing vehicle types is a consideration, especially if a larger \nvehicle is expected to traverse a portion of the sidewalk extension while turning where pedestrians might be \npresent.\nStandard:\n12\t\t\nCrosswalk markings shall not be extended through sidewalk extensions designated by pavement \nmarkings.\nSupport:\n13\t\t\nAccessibility provisions at sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings are outside the scope of \nthis Manual.

The U.S. Access Board (www.access-\nboard.gov) provides technical assistance for making pedestrian facilities accessible to persons with disabilities. \nGuidance:\n14\t\t\nTraffic control devices that are critical to the specific conditions at the sidewalk extension, such as STOP \nor YIELD signs or Pedestrian Crossing signs, should be located within the sidewalk extension designated by \npavement markings. Their lateral offset (see Section 2A.16) should be measured from the center of the double \nsolid line designating a sidewalk extension rather than from the physical curb line behind the sidewalk extension \narea so that the signs are more visible to approaching traffic and not occluded by any physical features placed \nwithin the sidewalk extension area.\nSupport:\n15\t\t\nThe location of accessible pedestrian signals (see Section 4K.02) is a consideration when providing a sidewalk \nextension designated by pavement markings.\n16\t\t\nAesthetic surface treatments (see Chapter 3H) are sometimes used in sidewalk extensions designated by \npavement markings to emphasize that the area is outside of the traveled way.\nStandard:\n17\t\t\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section 3H.03, aesthetic surface treatments, if used within a \nsidewalk extension designated by pavement markings, shall be non-retroreflective.\nSupport:\n18\t\t\nFigure 3J-6 illustrates an example of a sidewalk extension designated by pavement markings and an example \nof channelizing.\nPart 3.
